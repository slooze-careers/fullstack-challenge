# fullstack-challenge!

## Question:

How would you design and implement a full-stack role-based food ordering web application where users (Admins, Managers, and Members) can perform specific functions like viewing restaurants, placing or canceling orders, and managing payment methods based on their role, with an optional relational access model that restricts users to operate only within their assigned country (India or America), using any tech stack of your choice (e.g., NestJS and NextJS)?
