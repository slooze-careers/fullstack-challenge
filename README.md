# Slooze take home challenge-fullstack!!

## Question:

Design and implement a full-stack, role-based food ordering web application where users (Admins, Managers, and Members) can perform specific functions—such as viewing restaurants, placing or canceling orders, and managing payment methods—based on their assigned role.

**Assume**: Mock restaurants & menu items onto your app

**Extension**: Implement a relational access model that restricts users to operate only within their assigned country (India or America).

### 🎯 Feature Breakdown & Role-Based Access
| **Feature**                      | **Admin** | **Manager** | **Member** |
|----------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|
| View restaurants & menu items   | ✅       | ✅         | ✅         |
| Create an order (add food items)| ✅       | ✅         | ✅         |
| Checkout & pay                  | ✅       | ✅         | ❌         |
| Cancel an order                 | ✅       | ✅         | ❌         |
| Add / Modify payment methods    | ✅       | ❌         | ❌         |
